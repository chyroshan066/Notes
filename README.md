# News App

Notes App that allows you to create, read, update and delete notes. Also has login, signup and logout button for authentication. Used password hashing, salt and pepper to ensure extra security.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app running.

<br>To create React app through CRA, run the following command:
``` js
npx create-react-app "AppName"
```
The execution speed of the program created through create-react-app (CRA) is slow compared to that of vite. CRA is used to create those app which is bit complex and large.
<br>You can even create react app through vite. Run the following command if you want to create react app via vite;
``` js
npm create vite@latest
```
This create the app. After that you need to write the project & package name (you can even skip this part).
<br>Then choose the required framework using which you intend to build this app.
<br>Then choose the desired variant (Here you have 4 options: TypeScript, TypeScript with compiler, JavaScript & JavaScript with compiler).

Then run the following commands to navigate to the folder:
``` js
cd "folder_name"
```
Install all necessary packages using the following command;
``` js
npm install
```
**OR**
``` js
npm i
```
Then start the app using the following command;
``` js
npm run start
```
On following the link provided, you get to see the sample app.
<br>If you ever intend to change the command for runnig the code, you can do that by making some changes in the package.json file.

### Initial Configuration

Here are some of the dependencies and devDependencies packages needed to be installed for the project development:
<br>1. react-router-dom

```
To run index.js (from backend) and react-app (frontend) simultaneously, install 'concurrently' using the following command;
